              <p>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</p> 
              
              <p>JavaScript has been around for a while, but it has picked up traction over the last couple of years. It is beginning to fill the gap between strong web based languages (ie. Ruby, Python, etc.) and the weaker or non-existent basic languages (like BASIC).  Google created Chrome with a Document Object Model (DOM) in which you can run JavaScript code instantly through the browser and Ryan Dahl created Node.js, which allows you to run JavaScript through the terminal of any computer. This has lead to many programmers flocking back to JavaScript.  Now that there are may options and resources out there for beginner programmers to succeed.</p>
              
              <p>What are the great things about JavaScript?</p>
              
              <p>JavaScript is one of the more simple languages to learn and is often what beginner programmer’s start with.  It has a great advantage of being able to code live in the browser and now in the terminal with practically no setup involved.  JavaScript is also very fast since it is client-side, meaning that any code functions can be run instantly instead of having to find the server and wait for the answer to be returned.  JavaScript Is one of the most versatile languages, it can be entered into webpages regardless of its file extension (what kind of file it is) and can even be used inside of some other languages such as Perl and PHP.</p>
              
              <p>What are its limitations?</p>
              
              <p>JavaScript doesn’t always come across how you might want it to in every browser; different browsers interpret the JavaScript code in different ways.  This makes you have to do a lot of extra work, checking if the JavaScript works in every major browser.   Another, limitation or rather difficulty is that JavaScript can often be misinterpreted, you may think you’re on the right track but, if you’ve learned other languages first it may be difficult to understand why JavaScript works the way it does, but with a little practice and patience you will begin to grasp it.</p>
