    <p>***What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?***</p>
      <p>This was a tough one! we spent about an hour and a half getting it to work properly, I have to say I had fun with Youngsun!  The biggest problem we had was getting the Images to resize as the page decreased in width.</p>
    <p>***What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?***</p>
      <p>How to decide when to point the break-points in.  Which makes so much sense now (a little before the sites attributes start to break).  We used the resourses that DBC provided and, a little of just searching google for answers.  but honestly we just did a lot of trial and error in the DOM.</p>
    <p>***What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?***</p>
      <p>The responsive part was a bit wonky, we had everything working except for the image.  Then finally it clicked we weren't editing the code in the right container, it was nested. Then it took like 3 minutes to get everything running right.</p>
    <p>***Did you learn any new skills or tricks?***</p>
      <p>Um... Everything lol, breakpoints, media quierys, px to em, px to %... a lot</p>
    <p>***How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?***</p>
      <p>I feel fairly confident, I know I could do it again, it just might take me a little while.</p>
    <p>***Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?***</p>
      <p>Making the site responsive was a task, but when it was running I felt a sense of accomplishment</p>
    <p>***Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?***</p>
      <p>That img, the way it was nested, it took a while for us to figure it out.</p>
