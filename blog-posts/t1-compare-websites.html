              <p><a href="http://www.ign.com">IGN</a> is a game review website, I check it basically everyday.  On the homepage it has a scrolling display with their latest reviews.  It catches you right there and often they have a daily fix, which is a quick video of everything important that happened in the gaming world.   The site can definitely seem a little cluttered, but, I think its because they are trying to get so much information to you.  The only disadvantage to this is people who are unfamiliar to the site might find it difficult to navigate or find the hidden gems (less popular games/reviews).  Its updated frequently which gives it a fresh vibe everyday and because gaming is so visual, IGN really amps up the displays, so that you can really tell what these games look like.  I could spend hours without getting bored, watching review after review, listening to the vlogs, sometimes they even have live feed events that you can watch, like the League of Legends Championships.  If you do decided that you’d like to have premium access to the website you’ll get a couple of free games throughout the year and some perks as a prime member, but honestly I’ve been going to IGN for years and never even looked into paying for it.
              <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is one of the best sites out there for finding anything and everything.. I find myself losing hours upon hours looking up random dog videos, watching do it yourself home projects, then finishing the session off by watching the Philip DeFranco show to catch up on " the things that matter to me most". ( if you don't know who he is you should check out his YouTube channel ).  YouTube offers recommendations based off of what you been watching. It allows users to upload videos of anything for others to watch and enjoy. Simply put, It's a fantastic site for self-expression, discovery, and exploration
              <br><br><a href="http://postsecret.com/">Post Secret</a> is a website that is dedicated to peoples secrets.  People from all over the world send their secrets in to a man named Frank (The creator) on a postcard, and he picks a few, and posts them on this sort of picture blog. There isn't much to it so you can't really get lost, just postcard after postcard. I think the most interesting thing about this site other than reading other people's secrets is the idea that people can release something they've been keeping inside for such a long time very publicly without anybody knowing who it actually is.  It is updated every Sunday, and sometimes has a theme (Usually holiday based), it’s a nice way to start off your Sunday morning with a quick read of post secret.</p>
