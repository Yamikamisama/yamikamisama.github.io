              <p>Classes in Ruby: A fun Example</p>

              <p>Classes are a very useful tool that can be used in just about anything in Ruby, and on that note like anything else in ruby an object.  Classes are use to create new objects that all share similar traits. See example below. You could create a class for pets, an address book, students, worker info, or Characters in a video game.</p>

              <p>I have made a few different characters as if you were playing a video game, I chose to model it after final fantasy IV if you are familiar with the characters from that game, they all share certain traits.  A Name: Rydia, Rosa, and Cecil, A Type: referring to the type of hero they are Paladin, White Wizard, Summoner, an Attack: the attack that they use, and A catch_phrase: a witty phrase that they might say before they attack an enemy.</p>

              <center><img src="../img/class.png" alt=""></center>

              <p>First we need to initialize all the variables that we will be using to create all of the characters, this is referred to as initializing (the variables are called instance variables). We then have the ability to create as many characters as we want using #variable_name = Character.new(name, type, attack, catch_phrase). To call these instance variables to the screen I have created a second method allows us to put all of this information into a fun string using interpolation #{variable}.</p>

             <p> Now we have everything set up to actually create Characters. I created three Characters, however you can create as many as you’d like using the class Character (that's the beauty of it!).  In the parameter I enter the information to make my characters really come to life.</p>

              <p>And then at the end I run some code to test to make sure that the code is actually doing what I’d like it to do. Here is the terminal output:</p>

              <p>Just some tips for when you are building Classes: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Class names are written in camel case ThisIsAClassName. 
                  <li>If you ever wonder if something is a class use the #something.is_a? Class #true
                  <li>While your coding try to use driver test code to check that your code is working the way you would expect it to.
                  <li>If you don’t know how something may work try playing around with in IRB. Create a bunch of characters and manipulate them.
                </ul>
              </p>
