              <p>Dev Bootcamp: My Views on Pairing</p>

              <p>What is paring?</p>

              <p>I know Paring may sound self-explanatory, two people pairing together to complete a task, but Dev Bootcamp has taken it to an emotional level. Where it’s not just about getting the task done but also about creating a connection with the person you are paired with.  A normal session would entail, checking in with one another: How are you today? Is there anything outside of work that’s on your mind? How do you feel?</p>

              <p>After your done checking in you can move on to work, they ask you to use the approach that one person drives and the other navigates.  That could mean many different things so before you start the task, discuss what driver and navigator means to each of you, then select which role you would like to be in the pair.  Once that’s complete you can begin the actual task at hand.</p>

              <p>Dev Bootcamps approach to working with other people helps us develop skills that are paramount in the workforce.  It creates a way to socialize while working with another person, making the task fly by without really feeling like work. You run into a lot less tension between people because you have already discussed what your role will be with in the team and encourage one another to be creative and responsive.  It also helps in the learning process, being able to bounce ideas off one another in real time, and if you get stuck, you have someone to ask for help.</p>

              <p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>

              <p>I love working with other people! For me ideas are contagious, it takes one good one and then we just start making it better and better.  It’s also nice to have someone to use as a sounding board.  It creates a feeling of comerodery.</p>

              <p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>

              <p>Getting into Dev Bootcamp is a potentially a life changing decision, I’m not alone, and its nice to know that.  I find myself asking tons of questions about people’s lives and journey; feeling that were really all looking for the same thing… to be happy.</p>

             <p> Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>

              <p>Pairing can be done in any setting, for DBC’s Phase 0 most everything is done using online tools like Stypi and Google Hangouts.  This is great for connecting people from all over the world; but there is one downside to this.  Not everything works the way it should.  I’ll just share my first GPS experience with you.  We all met on Google Hangout, but for some reason none of the microphones were working, so we tried a different browser, that got two of our mics working. Then we switched to Skype and that didn’t work for the other two.  In the end we had to just call each other on the phone and use Stypi to edit the HTML file.</p>

              <p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>

              <p>All of my feedback has been so kind and helpful so I’ve enjoyed it.</p>

              <p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>

              <p>The purpose of feedback is to inform you what is working and what isn’t.  The constructive criticism is paramount for me; we often get stuck on things that we think are extremely important.  After reading my feedback I’ve realized that a lot of skills come with time, practice, and effort.</p>

              <p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>

              <p>I tend to want to guide and lead, but it’s important to let others develop those skills as well.  I need to stop saying sorry and putting myself down, and just trust that the other person’s words are not judgmental.  More often than not they are usually encouraging, it’s just my defense mechanism to apologize.</p>

              <p>How was it to write feedback?</p>

              <p>I’ve enjoyed it. I try to balance everything out, focusing on the positive parts of the pairing session and ending with some constructive criticism if there is any to be given.</p>

              <p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>

              <p>I’m usually all about efficiency so I tried to create a couple different formulas that I could use to make sure that I was giving everyone the same “fair hand”.  What I realized though is when focusing on emotional intelligence the circumstances of the task and person I’m paired with is constantly changing; it’s important for me to make the feed back unique as well.  I found with some people I used pros and cons, some I went off of feelings, others I talked more about code.</p>
