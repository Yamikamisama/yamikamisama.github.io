              <p><strong>A Quick Guide to Question Writing: What the Who?</strong></p>

              <p>In any industry it is important to know how to ask for help.  In this day in age we have a limitless amount of information at our fingertips, but every once in a while we will have to ask for help.  This may be in person, but there are hundreds of sites that allow you to post a question, and users can respond with their opinions.  I wanted to give you a quick guide on how to write a good question.</p>

              <p><strong>Step 1: Do the work</strong></p>

              <p>Research the problem, there are so many resources out there that can give you some insight on how to work through something step by step.  If you can’t find the information that you’re looking for, then you at least have some idea of what’s not working.  You may not have the answer but you probably narrowed down what you’re actually looking for.</p>

              <p><strong>Step 2: Title your post well</strong></p>

              <p>The title is the first thing that people are going to see; you need to make it a summary of what the specific problem is.  Don’t worry too much about it seeming like a long sentence, if the information is precise people will know immediately if they know the answer to the problem or not. Don’t title your posts with an unclear general question.  Ruby Array Mishap, doesn’t tell anybody anything… How do I access different indexes within an Array in Ruby? Lets everyone know what you are specifically looking to find out.</p>

              <p><strong>Step 3: The body</strong></p>

              <p>In the body of your post don’t just jump right with a code example; if the question is specific enough, someone may know the answer without requiring any code to fix.  Add in all errors that you are encountering, tag the appropriate language, API, and libraries. When needed just the snippets of code that aren’t functioning correctly.  WARNING: If you post all of your clients code on the web you are going to get into trouble. Keep it simple.</p>

              <p><strong>Step 4:  Double Check and Post</strong></p>

              <p>Go though the post again and make sure that everything is in place.  Check to make sure that it makes sense to you, could you recreate the problem without any other resources?  If you did miss anything edit the post and send it on through. </p>

              <p><strong>Step 5: Respond to others Feedback</strong></p>

              <p>Feedback is very important!  It can be one of the most valuable tools that you receive.  When someone gives you Feedback that is ASK (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) you have the opportunity to make yourself and your work that much better.  It shows that you have the follow through when you make the changes to your code, run it, and take the time to let the others know that it was successful.</p>

              <p>If you still feel that you need some help with this here are two great resources: <a href = "http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href = "http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">Writing the Perfect Question.</a>
