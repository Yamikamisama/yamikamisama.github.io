              <p>SQL Inject! Someone Hacked my Facebook?!</p>

              <p>We’ve been working with SQL for the past week becoming familiar with all the ins and outs of how a database language works.  So naturally I thought this post would be focused on one of the tricks that we learned during our studies.  So you can imagine my surprise that it has actually taught me how to become a mini hacker through SQL commands. But, I’m getting ahead of myself, let me explain.</p>

              <p>SQL Injection is a way that someone can hack their way into database to retrieve user information.  When you connect to the web server and give them all of your information it is translated, passed along, and stored in a database server.  The information stored could be anything from usernames and passwords to bank accounts and social security numbers.  When you log in to your account the server contacts the database to make sure that the information provided matches the information stored.</p>

              <pre>    SELECT id FROM users
    WHERE username = ‘michaelangelo’ 
    AND password = ‘xxxxxx’</pre>

              <p>So the way that hackers get around this is by basically throwing an error to find the weak spot and then, adding an or statement that will allow them to bypass the code above and make every password true.  In the login in box they would type in:</p>

              <pre>    test’ or 1=1--</pre>

              <p>And boom they are in, a couple more SQL commands and they have all the information they want, not to mention full access to the account they hacked.  This is much less common due to the advancement in security measures but it doesn’t hurt to be proactive.  A couple of things that you could do to be more protected are:</p>

              
                <ul>
                  <li>Test it out yourself, if you notice that there are holes in your coding, go back and rework the code so that it needs more specific commands and user input, so there cant be any tampering.</li>

                  <li>Use a firewall there are many free ones out there that will filter through potentially dangerous web requests!</li>

                  <li>Use data sanitization, e-mail addresses should be filtered to allow only the characters allowed in an e-mail address, phone numbers should be filtered to allow only the characters allowed in a phone number, and so on.</li>

                  <li>You may want to check out some encryption software that can turn your files into nonsense to everyone who doesn’t have the cipher.</li>
                </ul>
              

              <p>In this day and age it is important to put security measures in place wherever needed.  Plan ahead and do a little research about how your data is stored and who these website share it with.   If you have some time watch the YouTube video below that goes into a little more detail about SQL Injection.
