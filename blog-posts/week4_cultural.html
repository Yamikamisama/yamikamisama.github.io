              <p>Bigger Better Faster Stronger</p>

              <p>Technology is wonderful, we can call anyone from anywhere in the world, we can send letters from the convenience of our own home and have them arrive instantly, we can save TV shows and watch them anytime we want, and I’m sure you’ve all heard the wonderful phrase “there’s an app for that”.   As far as I’m concerned the technology industry will always be changing and advancing.</p>

              <p>The problem we are facing in the technology industry is adaptability. Every year Apple releases a new iPhone; it may not be a completely new iPhone with all new specs; it might just be a facelift with new software and maybe a small boost in its processor.   Consumers fall prey to the idea that their old product is no longer valid; it’s outdated now… obsolete.  What’s their solution? Go out and buy the new iPhone as soon as possible, unbeknownst to them it’s basically the same product that they have already.  As a society we have a bigger better faster stronger complex, we need something bigger, we need something better, need something faster, and we need something stronger.   This creates a lot of waste, envy, and stress amongst consumers.</p>

              <p>What if we had a modular phone that would allow us to upgrade certain parts instead of having to always throw away the old product and buy a new one. Lets say you wanted to run multiple programs with speed, you could switch out the processor and RAM, or if you really like watching videos you could upgrade the display and storage, enabling you to watch all your favorite movies. You get what you want, a customized experience that suits you, not a prepackaged set of specs that a new device forces (and costs).  I know that Google has been working on something like this (if you’d like to check it out I'll leave the article from wired here: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-project-ara/">Modular Phone</a>) This could then be spread across platforms, if you wanted to upgrade your PC, Laptop, or Gaming system, you could just buy the part that you were looking to enhance and then upgrade it without replacing the entire machine (for the advanced techie this already exists).  I realize that the bigger issue here is that it would decrease sales across the bored for devices vs. parts; but It would enable companies to really focus on individual specs instead of the device as a whole. </p>

              <p>Adaptability amongst the everyday consumer is just a seed right now, but I can foresee major companies seeing the importance of customization without waste, that will be the water that we need to help the seed grow!</p>
