INTERACTIVE MEDIA EXERCISE

You are tasked with building a 300 x 250px interactive creative.

The client has supplied a graphic mockup, and 3 poster images.

When creative loads, one of the 3 poster images should be shown at random.

The client requests that when clicking a thumbnail, the corresponding poster image related to that thumb will display.

When clicking a poster image, the posters should rotate in sequence, for example clicking on poster 1 should then display poster 2 then poster 3 then poster 1.

Feel free to be creative with design, hover effects, transitions.
